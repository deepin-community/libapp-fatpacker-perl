Description: module to pack dependencies onto script files
 While the proliferation of solutions like local::lib and cpanminus has made
 it a breeze to manage dependencies, there are still some rare occassions in
 which shipping code that has no external non-core dependencies is necessary.
 .
 App::FatPacker and the included fatpack script do the work of tracing,
 collecting packlists, extracting modules in fatlib, then concatenating into a
 packed script - in one shot.
