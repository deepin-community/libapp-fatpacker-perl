NAME
    App::FatPacker - pack your dependencies onto your script file

SYNOPSIS
      $ fatpack pack myscript.pl >myscript.packed.pl

    Or, with more step-by-step control:

      $ fatpack trace myscript.pl
      $ fatpack packlists-for `cat fatpacker.trace` >packlists
      $ fatpack tree `cat packlists`
      $ fatpack file myscript.pl >myscript.packed.pl

    Each command is designed to be simple and self-contained so that you can
    modify the input/output of each step as needed. See the documentation
    for the fatpack script itself for more information.

    The programmatic API for this code is not yet fully decided, hence the
    0.x release version. Expect that to be cleaned up for 1.0.

CAVEATS
    As dependency module code is copied into the resulting file as text,
    only pure-perl dependencies can be packed, not compiled XS code.

    The currently-installed dependencies to pack are found via .packlist
    files, which are generally only included in non-core distributions that
    were installed by a CPAN installer. This is a feature; see
    "packlists-for" in fatpack for details. (a notable exception to this is
    FreeBSD, which, since its packaging system is designed to work
    equivalently to a source install, does preserve the packlist files)
